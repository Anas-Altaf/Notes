There are a few offline AI models that work well for coding, but they are not as powerful as online AI models. One of the best offline AI models for coding is **Codex**, which is developed by OpenAI. Codex is a large language model that has been trained on a massive dataset of code. It can understand natural language descriptions of code and generate code in response.

Here are some of the things that Codex can do:

* Generate code from natural language descriptions
* Translate code between different programming languages
* Refactor code to improve its style and efficiency
* Fix bugs in code
* Complete code snippets

Codex is available as an API that you can integrate into your own applications. You can also use Codex through the GitHub Copilot extension, which provides real-time coding suggestions in your editor.

Another good offline AI model for coding is **TabNine**, which is developed by the company of the same name. TabNine is a code completion tool that uses machine learning to predict the next word or words that you are going to type. TabNine can be used with a variety of different programming languages, and it can be integrated into your editor or IDE.

TabNine is not as powerful as Codex, but it is much faster and more lightweight. This makes it a good option for developers who need real-time coding suggestions without sacrificing performance.

Both Codex and TabNine are available as paid services. However, there are also a few open-source offline AI models for coding that you can use for free. One of the most popular open-source offline AI models for coding is **Kite**, which is developed by the company of the same name. Kite is a code completion tool that uses machine learning to predict the next word or words that you are going to type. Kite can be used with a variety of different programming languages, and it can be integrated into your editor or IDE.

Kite is not as powerful as Codex or TabNine, but it is free and open-source. This makes it a good option for developers who are on a budget or who want to contribute to the development of open-source software.
